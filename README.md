# KNN-Algorithm-implementation
Implemented the KNN algorithm all by myself using Python, NumPy, Pandas

The KNN or K-nearest neighbour algorithm follows these steps:
1. Select the number K of the neighbors.
2. Calculate the Euclidean distance of K number of neighbors.
3. Take the K nearest neighbors as per the calculated Euclidean distance.
4. Among these k neighbors, count the number of the data points in each category.
5. Assign the new data points to that category for which the number of the neighbor is maximum.

My algorithm follows these few steps and shows the results with an accuracy/precision equivalent to sklearn's results.
